# Resume Screening with Machine Learning


## Introduction

In today's competitive job market, companies receive thousands of resumes for each job posting, making the task of hiring the right talent a significant challenge. To efficiently manage this process, businesses employ dedicated screening officers to sift through the vast number of applications.

Resume screening is especially critical for labor-intensive industries experiencing rapid growth and high attrition rates. The IT sector, being one of the fastest-growing markets, faces a similar challenge in identifying the best talent among numerous applicants with diverse technical skills and business domain expertise.

To tackle this issue effectively, machine learning algorithms come to the rescue. This project focuses on using various machine learning models to automate the process of resume screening and predicting which applicants are likely to receive callbacks.

## Project Objective
â€‹
The main objective of this project is to build a resume callback prediction model that helps companies filter and prioritize candidates based on their resumes. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, we aim to save time, effort, and resources in the hiring process, enabling organizations to focus on the most promising candidates.

## Machine Learning Models

We experimented with several popular machine learning algorithms for the prediction task, including:

- Random Forest<br>
- Decision Tree<br>
- AdaBoost<br>
- Naive Bayes<br>
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)<br>
- Logistic Regression<br>
- XGBoost<br>

## Model Evaluation
The performance of each model was evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. We used cross-validation techniques to ensure reliable and unbiased evaluation.

## Results and Conclusion
The final model achieved impressive accuracy and recall in predicting which candidates are likely to receive callbacks. By integrating this automated resume screening process into their hiring workflow, companies can significantly reduce the time and effort involved in manually reviewing each CV.

The implementation of machine learning algorithms for resume screening presents a valuable solution for optimizing talent acquisition and streamlining the hiring process in today's competitive job market.
